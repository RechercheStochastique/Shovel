The objective of a quantum computer program is often to get the value of alpha. So the program is run a large number of time and the relative frequancy of zeros is computed. By the law of large numbers that proportion will converge to alpha^2. The number of time the programs needs to run depends on the desired precision of the estimate. This precision is defined as a interval of confidence. That is, a maximum distance between the real value of alpha and the value of the estimate with a minimum probability. This can be rephrase as: {\\it the estimate does not differ from the real value by more than Delta with a probability greater than 1-gamma}. The parameters Delta and gamma are fixed by the program user and the program is run until the precision is met.","category":"page"},{"location":"Stop/","page":"Estimation for a single qubit","title":"Estimation for a single qubit","text":"Unfortunately, the number is required iterations is dependant on the unknown value so the user is left to do trial until the result is satisfactory.","category":"page"},{"location":"Stop/","page":"Estimation for a single qubit","title":"Estimation for a single qubit","text":"In the following paper we presents a method to sequentially assess is a sufficient number of iterations have been done to meet the precision requirements.
