The objective of a quantum computer program is often to get the value of <span>$\alpha$</span>. So the program is run a large number of time and the relative frequancy of zeros is computed. By the law of large numbers that proportion will converge to <span>$\alpha^2$</span>. The number of time the programs needs to run depends on the desired precision of the estimate. This precision is defined as a interval of confidence. That is, a maximum distance between the real value of <span>$\alpha$</span> and the value of the estimate with a minimum probability. This can be rephrase as: {\it the estimate does not differ from the real value by more than <span>$\Delta$</span> with a probability greater than <span>$1-\gamma$</span>}. The parameters <span>$\Delta$</span> and <span>$\gamma$</span> are fixed by the program user and the program is run until the precision is met.</p><p>Unfortunately, the number is required iterations is dependant on the unknown value so the user is left to do trial until the result is satisfactory.</p><p>In the following paper we presents a method to sequentially assess is a sufficient number of iterations have been done to meet the precision requirements. The users simply enters the precision parameters <span>$\Delta$</span> and <span>$\gamma$</span> and let the program iterate until it is reached.</p><p>In the first section we present the methods for estimating <span>$\alpha^2$</span> for one qubit at a time.

Typically, <span>$\Delta$</span> is defined by the number of significant digits: <span>$\Delta =2\times 10^{-k}$</span>, where <span>$k$</span> is the number of digits. The confidence level is defined by a small value of <span>$\gamma$</span> such as 5\%, 1\% or even less.

In order to determine such a value we must consider the case where <span>$p$</span> is very small and remember that is are satisfied with a precision of <span>$\Delta$</span> for our estimate. So any value of <span>$p$</span> estimated to be 0 while it is in fact smaller than <span>$\Delta$</span> is acceptable. </p><p>Assume now that <span>$p=\Delta$</span>, so that the probability that <span>$X_n=1$</span> is very high. Then the probability of getting a sequence of <span>$N$</span> ones in a row is given by <span>$(1-\Delta)^{N}$</span>. We dont want to mae the error of claming the <span>$p=0$</span> with a higher probability than <span>$1=\gamma$</span>.

If the noise is low, <span>$q$</span> will be close to 1 and <span>$1-q$</span> near 0 and negligeable, while <span>$2q-1$</span> is almost equal to 1 and negligeable as well.</p><p>The variance of <span>$Z_n$</span> is then equal to <span>$(p+q-2pq)(1-p-q+2pq)$</span> and the variance of the estimator in (\ref{unbiasEstim.eq}) is:</p><p class="math-container">\[V(\hat{p}) =  \frac{(p+q-2pq)(1-p-q+2pq)}{N(2q-1)^2}\]</p><p>And thre sample size can be treated similarly to the previous case as in (\ref{Nchapeau.eq}). One can see that as <span>$q$</span> gets near 0.5 the variance will increase and require sample size much larger.</p><p>The value of <span>$q$</span> has to be known for (\ref{unbiasEstim.eq}) to be useful. This can be based on past experiments made on the qubit and could be considered a calibrantion step.</p><h2 id="White-noise-increasing-with-time"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#White-noise-increasing-with-time">White noise increasing with time</a><a id="White-noise-increasing-with-time-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#White-noise-increasing-with-time" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>In the previous section we have have assumed that the white noise <span>$Y_n$</span> was a random variable with a constant probability <span>$q$</span> of altering the outcome of the measurement. In reality, qubits will progressively become noisier as the time goes by. The probability <span>$q$</span> is in fact a function of time <span>$q(t)$</span> which is 0 when t=0 and prgressively increases to 0.5.</p><p>A qubit is first initialised and them several calculation are done on it using logical gates. As these gates take a certain time to execute this must be added to the time of the qbit. If the time for each gate is a constant <span>$T_0$</span> then the time to perform the computation on the qubit is equal to the number of gates multiplied by the time used to execute the gate: <span>$q(t) = q(T_0 \times \mbox{Number of gates in the computation})=q(T_0 K)$</span>. The function <span>$q()$</span> could be approximated by an exponential such as:</p><p class="math-container">\[\begin{aligned}
q(t) =&amp; 0.5 \big(1-e^{-C_0 t}\big) \\
=&amp; 0.5 \big(1- e^{-C_0T_0 K} \big) \\
=&amp; 0.5 \big(1- e^{-B_0 K} \big)
\end{aligned}\]</p><p>where <span>$B_0$</span> is a constant for a given qubit. </p><p>Inseting the last line of (\ref{qExpo.eq}) into equations (\ref{unbiasEstim.eq}) and (\ref{varianceUnbiasEstim.eq}) we get:</p><p class="math-container">\[\hat{p} =\frac{N^{-1}\sum_{n=1}^{N} Z_n -(1-0.5 \big(1- e^{-B_0 K} \big))}{(20.5 \big(1- e^{-B_0 K} \big)-1)}\]</p><p>and</p><p class="math-container">\[V(\hat{p}) =  \frac{\big(p+0.5(1- e^{-B_0 K})-2p0.5(1- e^{-B_0 K})\big) \big(1-p-0.5(1- e^{-B_0 K})+2p0.5(1- e^{-B_0 K})\big)}{N\big( 20.5(1- e^{-B_0 K} )-1\big)^2}\]</p><p class="math-container">\[V(\hat{p}) =  \frac{\big(p+0.5(1- e^{-B_0 K})-p(1- e^{-B_0 K})\big) \big(1-p-0.5(1- e^{-B_0 K})+p(1- e^{-B_0 K})\big)}{N\big( (1- e^{-B_0 K} )-1\big)^2}\]</p><p class="math-container">\[V(\hat{p}) =  \frac{0.25 - \big(p-0.5\big)^2 e^{-2B_0 K} }{Ne^{-2B_0 K}}\]</p><h2 id="Computer-implementation"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Computer-implementation">Computer implementation</a><a id="Computer-implementation-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Computer-implementation" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>The formula mentionned above are used by the classical computer controling the quantum computer.
