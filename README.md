# Shovel

This package is designed to run on top of the Snowflake package developed by Anyon Systems. It is a group of utilities that quantum computer programmers will find useful.

Snowflake can either be used as a simple quantum computer simulator, or used for real with a connection to a Anyon Systems computer. The user should read Snowflake documentation before using shovel.
